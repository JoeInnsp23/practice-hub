# Gemini Code Assistant Context

This document provides context for the Gemini AI assistant to understand the `practice-hub` project.

## Project Overview

`practice-hub` is a multi-tenant business management application for UK accountancy firms. The project is a full-stack Next.js application built with TypeScript, React, and Node.js.

-   **Multi-tenancy**: The application supports multiple tenants, each with its own isolated data.
-   **User Management**: Users can be invited to a tenant and assigned different roles.
-   **Client Management**: A complete CRM for managing client information, contacts, and services.
-   **Task Management**: A task management system with features for assigning tasks, tracking progress, and setting due dates.
-   **Time Tracking**: Users can track their time spent on different tasks and projects.
-   **Invoicing**: The application can generate and manage invoices for clients.
-   **Document Management**: A system for uploading, storing, and sharing documents.
-   **Workflow Automation**: The application supports custom workflows to automate business processes.
-   **Compliance Management**: A dedicated module for tracking compliance-related tasks and deadlines.
-   **Activity Logging**: The application logs all user activities for auditing and monitoring purposes.
