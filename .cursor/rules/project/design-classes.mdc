description: Design — use tokens/classes via shared components
alwaysApply: true

- Use classes/tokens from `globals.css` via shared components (e.g., `.glass-card`, `.glass-subtle`, `.glass-table`).
- Avoid inline `bg-*`, `border`, and `shadow` styling.
- Extend the design system when a token is missing.
