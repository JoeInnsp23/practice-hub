description: Commit cadence — frequent, conventional commits
alwaysApply: true
---

- Commit when TODO list is complete; otherwise after:
  - logical change, 2+ files changed, >30 LOC, file add/remove,
  - lint/tests pass, or every 15 minutes.
- Use conventional commits `type(scope): summary` + bullets of key changes.
- For schema/seed updates, commit immediately after `pnpm db:reset`.
