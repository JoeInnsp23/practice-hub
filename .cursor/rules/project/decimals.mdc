description: Decimals — numbers in forms, strings at DB boundary
alwaysApply: true
---

- Forms: use number inputs with RHF `valueAsNumber` or `z.coerce.number()`.
- Transform at boundary: convert to strings for decimal DB columns; keep decimals as strings in Drizzle.
- Display: convert with `Number(str)` only for UI formatting; guard with `Number.isFinite`.
- Tests: assert stored values are strings and round-trip formatting is correct.
