# Documentation AI Index and Organization Rules

**Purpose:** Ensure AI agents always load the documentation index first and follow proper documentation organization.

## Context Rules

### Always Include (High Priority)

These files must be included when working with documentation:

1. **`docs/00-ai-index/README.md`** - MANDATORY: AI documentation index with load order and save rules
2. **`docs/20-dev-standards/DOCUMENTATION_GUIDE.md`** - Where to save different document types
3. **`docs/10-system/bmm-brownfield-architecture.md`** - Complete system reference (96 tables, 44 routers, 1,778 tests)

### Prefer Include (Medium Priority)

Load these as needed for specific tasks:

- `docs/30-reference/**` - API, database, config, security references
- `docs/40-guides/**` - Integration guides and specialized documentation
- `docs/50-operations/**` - Deployment and operational procedures

### Exclude from Default Context

These directories are excluded to reduce noise:

- `docs/70-research/**` - Research projects (pricing, market analysis) - load explicitly when needed
- `**/.archive/**` - Old CRM app reference (project root only) - NEVER modify
- `docs/audit/**` - Historical audit reports - reference only

---

## Documentation Creation Guardrails

### Before Creating ANY Documentation

**MANDATORY CHECKLIST:**

1. ✅ Read `docs/00-ai-index/README.md` first
2. ✅ Check `docs/20-dev-standards/DOCUMENTATION_GUIDE.md` for correct location
3. ✅ Verify content doesn't already exist in `bmm-brownfield-architecture.md` or `coding-standards.md`
4. ✅ Confirm correct numbered bucket (10/20/30/40/50/60/70/90)

### Prohibited Actions

**DO NOT:**
- ❌ Create files in `docs/` root (max 7 core files allowed)
- ❌ Create stub/placeholder files (<500 words) unless in `60-active-planning/` with phase owner
- ❌ Create duplicate documentation for existing content
- ❌ Create subdirectories for single files
- ❌ Add files to `.archive/` (old CRM app reference only - project root)

### Required Actions

**ALWAYS:**
- ✅ Check `DOCUMENTATION_GUIDE.md` before creating any documentation
- ✅ Use numbered taxonomy (00/10/20/30/40/50/60/70/90) for organization
- ✅ Place active planning in `60-active-planning/{category}/`
- ✅ Place completed phases in `90-completed/{phase-name}/`
- ✅ Ask user if unsure about location or if creating new category

## Numbered Taxonomy Reference

```
00-ai-index/          AI entry point (MANDATORY first read)
10-system/            System architecture & core docs
20-dev-standards/     Coding standards & documentation guide
30-reference/          API, database, config, security
40-guides/            Integration guides & specialized docs
50-operations/         Deployment & operational procedures
60-active-planning/    Active phases, launch plans, sprints
70-research/          Research projects (excluded from default context)
90-completed/          Completed phases, historical reports
```

## Prompt Instructions

When creating new documentation, include this prompt instruction:

> "Before creating any documentation, check `docs/20-dev-standards/DOCUMENTATION_GUIDE.md` to determine the correct location based on document type. Verify the content doesn't duplicate existing documentation in `bmm-brownfield-architecture.md` or `coding-standards.md`. Use the numbered taxonomy (00-90) for proper organization."
