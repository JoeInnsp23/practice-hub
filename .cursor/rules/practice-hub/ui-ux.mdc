## Practice Hub UI/UX — Project Rule (Cursor)

Scope: Applies to all product UI in this repository (Next.js App Router). These rules make the interface feel precise, warm, and easy, while remaining distinctive per hub.

### Brand & Personality
- Precise, warm, easy (authoritative tone; never flashy for its own sake).
- Typeface: Outfit for all text tiers (headings, body, UI).
- No A/B testing in product UX; we ship opinionated, high‑polish design.

### Multi‑Hub Theming (authoritative)
- Use `HUB_COLORS` and the hub root wrapper to theme per hub.
  - Wrap hub pages with `data-hub-root` and set `--hub-color` so components inherit hub accent.
  - Primary color and focus ring are derived from hub color.
- Gradients & tints are auto‑derived; do not hand‑roll hex variants.

### Visual System
- Surfaces: Hybrid
  - Product UI: bordered/flat (solid backgrounds), low shadow depth.
  - Marketing/highlights: glass allowed in moderation.
  - Keep the animated accent rail for interactive cards.
- Density & radii
  - Medium density by default.
  - Radii from tokens: base `--radius: 0.5rem`; use `--radius-lg` for cards/panels.
- Color & contrast
  - Maintain WCAG 2.1 AA contrast; prefer neutral surfaces with hub‑accent accents.
  - Use hub gradients/tints (see Gradient Tokens) instead of generic rainbow/AI blobs.

### Motion & Interaction
- Motion personality: gentle (160–220ms ease‑out, low amplitude).
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`; disable non‑essential transforms.
- Hover/focus affordances must be clear and consistent.

### Components — Required Defaults
- Cards
  - Use `Card` for static content; `CardInteractive` for clickable/interactive blocks.
  - `CardInteractive` uses the animated hub gradient rail; keep it enabled.
- Buttons
  - Primary = solid accent (flat), inherits hub color automatically.
  - Focus halo is hub‑accent; disabled states reduce opacity (no color shifts).
- Inputs
  - Soft filled boxes with subtle border; hub‑accent focus ring.
  - Inline validation with clear, concise messaging.
- Tables
  - Hairline row dividers with hover highlight; avoid zebra striping.
  - Sticky headers and progressive disclosure for dense views where needed.
- Icons
  - Duotone icons with subtle gradient (hub accent fill + neutral base), 1.5px rounded stroke.
  - Fallback to outline at ≤16px for clarity.
- Header/Sidebar
  - Keep neutral surfaces with hub‑accent indicators (current pattern).

### Gradient & Tint Tokens (usage)
- Use hub‑derived utilities instead of bespoke CSS:
  - Accent rails/badges: `.bg-hub-rail`
  - Stronger CTA strips/hero chips: `.bg-hub-cta`
  - Soft section backgrounds: `.bg-hub-soft`
  - Gradient headings: `.text-hub-gradient`

### Accessibility (must)
- WCAG 2.1 AA minimum for text/icons.
- Keyboard first: `:focus-visible` rings (hub‑accent) on all interactive elements.
- Provide alt text for non‑text media; announce async states (live regions when needed).
- Respect reduced motion and high‑contrast user settings.

### Performance & Quality
- Optimize icons/illustrations (SVG preferred; minimal DOM).
- Lazy load non‑critical media; code‑split heavy views.
- Keep motion GPU‑friendly (opacity/transform only); prefer CSS animations.

### Content & IA
- Clear visual hierarchy (typographic scale, spacing rhythm).
- Progressive disclosure; avoid overwhelming first views.
- Consistent terminology and tone; concise, purposeful microcopy.

### Consistency & System Use
- Use shared components first; do not hand‑roll styles that exist in the design system.
- Use design tokens and hub utilities (`--hub-color`, gradient classes); avoid hardcoded hex/rgb.
- Keep light/dark parity; verify in both themes before merging.

### Prohibited (anti‑goals)
- Generic “AI SaaS” visual clichés: neon purple/blue blob gradients, excessive glass, chat‑bubble chrome.
- Introducing alternate toast/notification libraries (use `react-hot-toast`).
- Overly heavy shadows, low‑contrast text, or focus states that rely only on color.

### Review Checklist (PR gate)
- [ ] Uses shared components and tokens; no bespoke hex colors.
- [ ] Hub accent applied via `data-hub-root`; focus rings are hub‑accented.
- [ ] Surfaces follow hybrid rule; animated rail kept for interactive cards.
- [ ] Buttons = solid accent; inputs = soft filled; tables = hairline + hover.
- [ ] Motion is gentle; respects reduced‑motion.
- [ ] Passes AA contrast; keyboard navigation works end‑to‑end.
- [ ] Verified in light and dark themes.

Notes
- Hub colors live in `lib/utils/hub-colors.ts`; gradients and hub variables in `app/globals.css`.
- Follow repository “Critical Design Elements” and error/logging policies in `CLAUDE.md`.
