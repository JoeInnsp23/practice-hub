# Quality Gate Decision - Story 4.2
schema: 1
story: "4.2"
story_title: "Staff Capacity Planning & Utilization Tracking"
gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: "Solid implementation with all 12 ACs met, but test coverage is limited to smoke tests and performance optimization opportunities exist. Recommend addressing before production."
reviewer: "Quinn (Test Architect)"

top_issues:
  - id: "TEST-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "Tests are primarily structural/smoke tests - lack comprehensive integration tests with real data scenarios (e.g., capacity overlaps, edge cases, timezone boundaries)"
    suggested_action: "Add integration tests covering capacity history changes, utilization calculations with real time entries, and edge cases"
    suggested_owner: dev
  - id: "PERF-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "N+1 query pattern in getUtilization and getUtilizationTrends procedures using Promise.all with individual DB queries per user"
    suggested_action: "Consider batch query optimization for teams >20 staff, or document acceptable performance threshold"
    suggested_owner: dev
  - id: "MONITOR-001"
    severity: low
    finding: "UI error handlers use toast.error but don't capture exceptions with Sentry (per CLAUDE.md Error Tracking policy)"
    suggested_action: "Add Sentry.captureException in mutation error handlers for unexpected errors"
    suggested_owner: dev
  - id: "VALID-001"
    severity: low
    finding: "No validation preventing overlapping or conflicting capacity records for same user with different effective dates"
    suggested_action: "Add business logic validation to prevent capacity record conflicts"
    suggested_owner: dev

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Multi-tenant isolation verified across all 26 tenantId references. No console.log leaks. TRPCError used for backend errors. No security vulnerabilities found."
  performance:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "N+1 query pattern acceptable for expected scale (<50 staff) but could impact larger organizations. Recommend load testing or query optimization."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Proper error handling with TRPCError. Edge case handling for users without capacity records. Division by zero protection in utilization calculation."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean code structure with type safety via tRPC + Drizzle ORM. Proper use of Zod validation. Good component separation. No console statements."
