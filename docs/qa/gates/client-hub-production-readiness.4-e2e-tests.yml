# Gate Decision
decision: "CONCERNS"
confidence: "HIGH"

# Risk Assessment
risk_level: "MEDIUM"
risk_factors:
  - "Tests not executed (requires manual user verification)"
  - "No data-testid attributes added (relies on fallback selectors)"
  - "Test stability unverified (flakiness potential)"
  - "Large implementation (18 files, 1000+ lines)"
  - "Zero test execution evidence"

# Requirements Traceability

# Code Quality Assessment
code_quality:
  architecture: "EXCELLENT"
  test_structure: "EXCELLENT"
  cleanup_strategy: "EXCELLENT"
  documentation: "EXCELLENT"
  error_handling: "GOOD"

  strengths:
    - "Clean separation: infrastructure, helpers, tests"
    - "Comprehensive test data factory with E2E-Test- prefix"
    - "Robust cleanup with verification helpers"
    - "Detailed 420-line E2E testing guide"
    - "Proper test database isolation (port 5433)"
    - "Serial execution prevents conflicts"

  concerns:
    - "No test execution evidence"
    - "Missing data-testid attributes (selector brittleness)"
    - "No CI/CD integration implemented"
    - "Flakiness potential unverified"
    - "No performance benchmarks"

# Non-Functional Requirements
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: "PASS"
    notes: "Test database isolated, credentials in .env.test, no secrets in code"

  performance:
    status: "UNKNOWN"
    notes: "Serial execution chosen, but no benchmarks or timeout validation"

  reliability:
    status: "CONCERNS"
    notes: "Cleanup helpers excellent, but test stability unverified"

  maintainability:
    status: "EXCELLENT"
    notes: "Outstanding documentation, clear patterns, reusable helpers"

  testability:
    status: "CONCERNS"
    notes: "Infrastructure solid, but missing data-testid attributes"

# Blocker Issues
blockers: []

# Critical Issues
critical_issues:
  - issue: "Zero test execution"
    severity: "HIGH"
    impact: "Cannot verify tests actually work"
    recommendation: "Run pnpm test:e2e and document results"

  - issue: "Missing data-testid attributes"
    severity: "MEDIUM"
    impact: "Tests may be brittle and flaky"
    recommendation: "Add data-testid to key UI elements"

# Warnings
warnings:
  - "Flexible selectors (text, role, name) may break on UI changes"
  - "No CI/CD integration blocks automation"
  - "Test stability unverified (race conditions, timing issues)"
  - "Document upload test requires actual file (fixture exists but untested)"

# Recommendations
recommendations:
  immediate:
    - action: "Execute all E2E tests and document results"
      priority: "CRITICAL"
      effort: "15 minutes"

    - action: "Add data-testid attributes to critical UI elements"
      priority: "HIGH"
      effort: "2 hours"
      targets:
        - "Client creation form inputs/buttons"
        - "Task management components"
        - "Document upload components"
        - "Invoice generation form"

    - action: "Run stability test (5 consecutive runs)"
      priority: "HIGH"
      effort: "30 minutes"

  future:
    - action: "Integrate E2E tests into CI/CD pipeline"
      priority: "MEDIUM"
      effort: "4 hours"

    - action: "Add visual regression testing"
      priority: "LOW"
      effort: "8 hours"

    - action: "Implement test performance benchmarks"
      priority: "LOW"
      effort: "4 hours"

# Gate Conditions Met
conditions_met:
  - "Test infrastructure complete (database, Playwright, helpers)"
  - "Test files created for all 5 critical workflows"
  - "Cleanup strategy implemented and verified"
  - "Documentation comprehensive and clear"
  - "No security concerns identified"

# Gate Conditions Not Met
conditions_not_met:
  - "Tests not executed (zero evidence of passing tests)"
  - "data-testid attributes missing (selector stability)"
  - "Test stability unverified (flakiness potential)"
  - "No CI/CD integration (manual only)"

# Next Steps
next_steps:
  - "Developer: Run pnpm test:e2e and attach results"
  - "Developer: Add data-testid attributes per recommendations"
  - "Developer: Run stability test (5x) and document"
  - "QA: Re-review after test execution evidence provided"
  - "QA: Validate test stability and selector robustness"

  decision_rationale: |
    Story 4 demonstrates EXCELLENT architecture and code quality. The test infrastructure
    is well-designed with proper isolation, cleanup, and documentation. However, the
    complete absence of test execution evidence is a critical gap. We cannot verify that
    these tests actually work, pass, or are stable. The missing data-testid attributes
    also introduce selector brittleness risk.

    GATE DECISION: CONCERNS (not PASS, not FAIL)

    Recommendation: Execute tests and add data-testid attributes before production deployment.
    The implementation quality is high enough that these concerns are addressable quickly.
