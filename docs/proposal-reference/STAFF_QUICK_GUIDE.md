## Model A vs Model B Decision Tree

```
START: Do you have transaction data?
  ├─ NO → Use Model A only
  └─ YES → Calculate both
      │
      ├─ Transactions LOW for turnover?
      │  └─ YES → Model B likely cheaper
      │
      ├─ Transactions HIGH for turnover?
      │  └─ YES → Model A likely cheaper
      │
      └─ Similar? → Use Model A (simpler)
```

### Quick Rules:

**Use Model B for:**
- Service businesses
- Consultants
- B2B with few large invoices
- < 100 transactions/month

**Use Model A for:**
- Retail/e-commerce

## Common Client Objections

### "That seems expensive"
Response: "Compared to what? Most accountants in our area charge [X]. We're actually quite competitive, and here's what you're getting for that price..."

### "Can you do it cheaper?"
Response: "Our pricing is very fair for the market. However, if budget is tight, we could start with just the essentials [list] and add services later as you grow?"

### "I'll think about it"
Response: "Of course! What specifically would you like to think about? Is it the price, the services included, or something else? I'd be happy to adjust the quote if needed."

### "My current accountant charges less"
Response: "That's interesting - what services do they include for that price? [Often they're getting less]. Also, are they local and accessible, or are you dealing with an overseas service center?"
