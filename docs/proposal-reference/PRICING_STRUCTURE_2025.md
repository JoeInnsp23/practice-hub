## Overview

This document defines our complete modular, component-based pricing system. We've moved away from rigid package tiers to a flexible system where clients pay only for the services they need, priced accurately based on either their turnover or transaction volume.

### Key Features

- **Modular Services**: Pick and choose individual services
- **Dual Pricing Models**: Choose turnover-based or transaction-based pricing
- **Transparent Pricing**: Clients see exactly what they're paying for
- **Data-Driven**: Use actual Xero data for accurate quotes
- **Scalable**: Works for micro-businesses to £5M+ turnover companies

---

## Philosophy

### Why Modular Pricing?

1. **Fairness**: Low-transaction clients don't subsidize high-transaction clients
2. **Flexibility**: Add/remove services as business needs change
3. **Competitiveness**: Can undercut package-based competitors
4. **Transparency**: No hidden costs or surprise fees
5. **Accuracy**: Transaction data = precise pricing

### When to Use Each Model

**Model A (Turnover-Based):**
- New clients without transaction data
- Quick quotes needed
- Industry-standard pricing
- Client prefers simplicity

**Model B (Transaction-Based):**
- Existing Xero users
- Historical data available
- More accurate pricing required
- High or low transaction volumes relative to turnover

---

## Pricing Models

### Model A: Turnover-Based Pricing

Traditional approach using turnover bands as the primary pricing factor.

**Formula:**
```
Service Price = Base Price [turnover band] × Complexity Multiplier × Industry Multiplier
```

**Complexity Multipliers:**
- Clean books: 0.95
- Average: 1.0
- Complex/Poor records: 1.15
- Disaster zone: 1.4

**Industry Multipliers:**
- Simple (consultancy, freelance): 0.95
- Standard (most businesses): 1.0
- Complex (retail, hospitality, construction): 1.15
- Regulated (financial services): 1.3

---

### Model B: Transaction-Based Pricing

Data-driven approach using actual monthly transaction volumes.

**Formula:**
```
Service Price = Base Price + (Transactions × Rate [transaction band]) × Complexity Multiplier
```

**Transaction Definition:**
Any bank movement including:
- Income/sales
- Expenses/purchases
- Transfers (counted once)
- Bank fees
- Refunds
- Adjustments

**Complexity Multipliers (Lower Impact):**
- Clean books: 0.95
- Average: 1.0
- Complex/Poor records: 1.1
- Disaster zone: 1.25

## Calculation Logic

### Step 1: Service Selection

1. Client selects required services
2. System identifies if service supports Model B pricing
3. If transaction data available, calculate both models
4. If no data, use Model A only

### Step 2: Model A Calculation

```
For each service:
  base_price = SERVICE_PRICES[turnover_band][service]

  If service has complexity factor:
    base_price = base_price × COMPLEXITY_MULTIPLIER[complexity]

  base_price = base_price × INDUSTRY_MULTIPLIER[industry]

total = sum(all service prices)
```

### Step 3: Model B Calculation

```
For each service that supports Model B:
  If per-transaction pricing:
    price = BASE_PRICE + (transactions × RATE[transaction_band])

  If service has complexity factor:
    price = price × COMPLEXITY_MULTIPLIER[complexity]

total = sum(all service prices)
```

### Step 4: Apply Global Modifiers

```
If subtotal > £500:
  total = total × 0.95  // 5% volume discount

If subtotal > £1000:
  total = total × 0.92  // 8% volume discount

If rush_job:
  total = total × 1.25  // 25% rush fee

If first_year_discount_approved:
  total = total × 0.9  // 10% new client discount
```

### Step 5: Compare & Recommend

```
If only Model A calculated:
  recommend Model A

If both models calculated:
  difference = abs(modelA - modelB)
  percent_diff = (difference / modelA) × 100

  If percent_diff < 10%:
    recommend Model A (simpler)
  Else:
    recommend cheaper model
```

## Implementation Notes

### For Staff/Sales Team

1. **Always collect transaction data if possible** - More accurate quotes
2. **Calculate both models when data available** - Show client the savings
3. **Document complexity clearly** - Use photos, notes, screenshots
4. **Get approval for discounts** - First-year discounts need sign-off
5. **Build quote in stages** - Start with core services, add extras

### For Developers

1. **Service components are modular** - Each can be toggled independently
2. **Pricing rules stored in database** - Easy to update without code changes
3. **Both models must be calculated** - Even if one is obviously better
4. **Cache Xero data** - Don't fetch every time, refresh monthly
5. **Audit trail required** - Log all pricing calculations

### For Management

1. **Review pricing quarterly** - Market rates change
2. **Monitor Model A vs B usage** - Which is more common?
3. **Track win/loss by pricing model** - Does transparency help?
4. **Service profitability analysis** - Which services are most profitable?
5. **Discount policy enforcement** - Ensure discounts are approved
