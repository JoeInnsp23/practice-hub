Kate is the founder of a curated gifting marketplace, building her business from the ground up alongside her husband. She’s currently in the pre-revenue stage but is ready to kickstart growth and scale quickly. Her goal is to structure both her business and personal finances smartly while growing the company, navigating a new country, and making the most of every pound.

Kate Hamilton is the solo founder of We are The Helpful, a curated gifting marketplace. The business has been running for eight months, focusing initially on polishing the website and building momentum on the supply side. Turnover to date is minimal, just over £1,000, with no profit yet as the business is still pre-revenue. Kate’s plan is ambitious: she aims to reach £150k turnover within the next 12 months.

Currently, bookkeeping is managed through Xero with accountant support for tax compliance. Kate and her husband are Australian, and as newcomers to the UK, they need a trustworthy accountant who can help them navigate the UK system. They’re seeking guidance not only on compliance but also on maximising their money. Kate wants support in both personal and business finances, including smart decisions around expenses, childcare, rent claims, and planning for growth while bootstrapping the business with their personal finances.

Jordan set up his business originally with plans for accommodation but has since been using it to carry out freelance research work. Alongside this, he and his wife are preparing for their next venture in hospitality. They’re now looking for the right accountant to guide them through their first returns and help them feel confident about their financial decisions.

Jordan Vient runs Vient Solutions, a business initially set up for accommodation but currently used for freelance research work following redundancy. At the same time, Jordan and his wife are preparing to expand into hospitality, aiming to secure planning permission for a glamping site on their land and considering the purchase of a property for holiday letting.

Since starting in July 2024, the business has generated £45,000 turnover with around £40,000 profit. Jordan and his wife manage everything themselves, with Monzo currently handling invoicing and payments. They have an accountancy firm they use, but often find it difficult to get the proactive advice and support they need.

The main challenges right now are preparing for their first ever returns, understanding what can and cannot be claimed through the business, and ensuring they are tax-efficient as they grow. They want an accountant who can explain things clearly, help them feel in control, and set them up with a system that supports both their freelance income and their upcoming accommodation projects.

Jessica is a food content creator and cookbook author who has been running her business full-time for the past three years. She’s now ready to take things up a level and is looking for the right accountant to support her growth. Her next step is making sure her finances are structured properly so she can scale with confidence.

Jessica Hawkins is the creator behind Recipeswith_jess, a food content and cookbook business she has been running full-time for the past 3 years.

In the last 12 months, Jessica achieved £65,000 turnover with around £60,000 profit. Her goal for the next year is to push revenue to £100k while building a more professional financial foundation.

Currently, Jessica manages her records on Excel spreadsheets, with some informal help on her self-assessment. While this has worked so far, she wants to transition to a more accurate, professional system that keeps HMRC satisfied and supports her growth ambitions.

She’s particularly looking for an accountant who can:

 * Advise on business structure — should she remain a sole trader or become a limited company as she grows past £100k?
   
   
 * Help her get set up properly — moving from spreadsheets to robust accounting software with clear systems.
   
   
 * Provide ongoing compliance and support — giving her peace of mind that everything is being done correctly as she scales.
   
   

This is a great opportunity for an accountant who enjoys supporting creatives and content entrepreneurs, helping them transition from early-stage setups to more structured, scalable businesses.

Donna has been running her consultancy, ToDoForYou, for 7 years and she’s now ready to scale. Moving from subcontractors to employees. She’s looking for an accountant who can give her clarity on whether to remain a sole trader or transition to a limited company, and help her build the financial structure needed to grow confidently.

Donna Collins runs ToDoForYou, a business management and marketing consultancy she has grown steadily over the last 7 years. Her turnover in the last 12 months was around £80,000, with a strong profit of £70,000.

Currently working with subcontractors, Donna’s next step is to scale her operations by employing staff and expanding her client base. She currently uses an accountant for her annual tax return, but her day-to-day expense management is inconsistent, and she feels she lacks the financial understanding to make key decisions about the future.

Specifically, Donna is looking for an accountant who can:

 * Advise on sole trader vs. limited company — helping her understand the tax and strategic implications of both, so she can choose the best structure for growth.
   
   
 * Build a financial roadmap for scaling — ensuring she can confidently move from subcontractors to employees.
   
   
 * Provide ongoing guidance — not just compliance, but proactive advice that supports her long-term business goals.

He’s looking for an accountant who can give him peace of mind, get everything up to date, and create a clear roadmap for the future.

Jack Taylor Webster has been trading as a sole trader for the past 3 years but is now ready to overhaul his finances and move forward in a structured way. His turnover for the last 12 months is around £80,000, but he admits his bookkeeping has fallen behind — with undeclared income that needs to be addressed. Currently, he uses Ember for invoicing but has no real system in place for bookkeeping.

Jack is looking for:

 * A full revamp of past accounts — including backdated expense tracking and declaration of income.
   
   
 * Guidance on transitioning to a limited company — to ensure he’s set up tax efficiently now that his income is growing.
   
   
 * Ongoing organisation and peace of mind — he feels anxious when handling finances, which leads to avoidance. Having an accountant who can simplify the process and build confidence is key.
   
   
 * A roadmap for the future — including advice on savings, paying himself as a director, and sustainable tax planning.

Ross Parr runs Youth Sports Development, a business that has been established for 10 years and now generates turnover of around £80,000 annually, with £10,000 profit.

Olivia is an educational content creator with a thriving online presence, producing engaging science videos and resources for students. She’s now earning well into six figures from multiple revenue streams, but managing the financial side has become a major challenge. She’s looking for an accountant who can bring clarity, structure, and support as she levels up her business.

Olivia Legg runs Biology with Olivia, an educational content business that combines social media content creation, brand partnerships, online masterclasses, and the sale of her own revision guides for GCSE and A Level Biology. She has been fully self-employed for two years, following three years of running the business alongside her teaching career. In the past 12 months, turnover has exceeded £100,000, though she admits she isn’t fully clear on the profit position due to varied revenue streams and a changeover to Xero partway through the year.

Her income comes from multiple channels — Stan Store, TES, direct brand deals, and digital sales — making her finances more complex than a standard sole trader. At present, bookkeeping and accounting are handled by Lambert Chapman (Braintree) through Xero, with Olivia uploading receipts and invoices to a shared Google Drive. However, she has found the service unclear and confusing, often feeling like she doesn’t know what’s being done or when. She’s also spending far too much time on admin, preventing her from focusing on growth opportunities.

The company has a clear model: a two-person team, systemising and automating processes to scale without hiring staff in the near term.

Currently, Wyler Marketing uses Crunch accounting software and services.

More importantly, she feels the lack of a single point of contact has made it harder to get consistent advice.

Hope is a passionate nail technician and educator who has been building her own business over the last two years. She’s now turning her attention to growth, with a vision of expanding her training academy and taking her skills overseas. To get there, she knows she needs more structure in her finances so she can focus on scaling with confidence.

Hope Laurwt is the founder of Byhopeaphena, where she works as both a nail technician and an educator, offering specialist training in the beauty industry. She has been running her business for two years as a sole trader and is now looking at ways to grow her training academy, expand into retreats, and create opportunities abroad.

At present, Hope does not have a bookkeeping or accounting system in place, and she hasn’t been tracking turnover or profit consistently. This lack of clarity has made it harder for her to plan for growth, which is why she’s seeking support. Her priority is to get organised with day-to-day or weekly record keeping so she always knows where she stands financially.

Hope is looking for an accountant who can help her build a clear, simple system for tracking numbers, provide proactive guidance, and support her as she scales her training and international work.

Louise works behind the scenes in film and TV, managing the logistics that bring big productions to life. She recently went out on her own and is learning to balance the creative chaos of production work with the demands of running a business. Right now, she’s looking for someone who can bring structure and clarity to her finances - so she can focus on what she does best.

Louise Caulfield is the founder of Wilmaxx Media, a newly established production management company working across film and television projects in the UK. Louise brings years of industry experience to her work, and after launching her business less than a year ago, she’s already on track to generate around £88,000 in turnover this year. She currently works as a sole trader and has one employee supporting the business.

Louise uses QuickBooks to handle her day-to-day bookkeeping, but she feels her current accountant isn’t offering the level of guidance or clarity she needs. She often feels unsure about compliance, HMRC obligations, and how to get the most out of her business financially. What she’s looking for is someone proactive - an accountant who can explain things clearly, ensure nothing slips through the cracks, and help her build a solid financial foundation for the long term.

Hannah runs a mobile bar business that has been going for 7 years. She’s about to take on a franchise and is looking for support in creating a clear financial plan to strengthen her next stage of growth.

Hannah Jackson is the founder of The Bar Tailors, a business specialising in retail sale via stalls and markets of food, beverages, and tobacco products, primarily through mobile bars. The business has been trading successfully for 7 years and turned over around £160,000 in the last 12 months. While profit isn’t fully clear due to historic challenges, Hannah has built up a strong customer base and is now preparing to expand by taking over a franchise.

The main challenge at present is managing the transition into VAT, paired with a tax liability that built up during a period of change - Hannah had a baby around the same time as crossing the VAT threshold, which meant prices weren’t increased as they should have been. She has already taken the right first step by setting up a savings account with £10,000 saved towards repayment, and now she wants a structured plan to clear outstanding tax, keep her spending on track, and prepare her finances for the new franchise.

Hannah currently uses QuickBooks for her bookkeeping and stays fairly up to date, but would like support with budgeting, financial planning, and especially accountability. Her business is profitable and stable, but she’s clear that she needs guidance to ensure cash is managed properly, expenses are controlled, and growth is sustainable.

Anjali Simons has recently launched Roots2Rise Therapy Ltd. She’s brand new to running her own business and openly admits that while she’s confident in her therapeutic work, she has little knowledge of accounting, tax, or director responsibilities. Her honesty and drive to get this right show just how much she wants to build strong financial foundations from the start.

She isn’t currently using any accounting software, and her experience with her current accountant has been limited to end-of-year filing. This lack of communication has left her struggling to stay on top of her numbers day-to-day. She would love to move towards having ongoing insights, guidance, and clarity, so she can plan ahead and feel more in control.

Key priorities for Anjali include:

 * Ongoing financial insights and advice, rather than reactive support
   
   
 * Help setting up and learning accounting software
   
   
 * Ensuring her personal address remains private on Companies House
   
   
 * A more proactive, supportive relationship with her accountant
   
   

She is at a very early stage, so turnover and profit figures aren’t yet clear. Anjali doesn’t have employees at present, but she does have plans to grow her practice once the financial side is set up securely.

She hasn’t yet started trading but has ambitious plans: in year one she hopes to sell 500 coats, scaling up to around 5,000 coats by year four, which could generate roughly £1m profit based on her early forecasts.

Martha is currently funding the business through savings and wants to invest wisely in professional support from the start. She describes herself as “scattered” with personal finances, so having clear, reliable guidance around bookkeeping, reporting, and tax planning is a priority. She would like an accountant who can provide not just compliance but practical advice, helping her set up well now and avoid mistakes later.

As she has just started out, she is currently not using any software, so will need guidance on the best way to track things from the start, so she can stay on top of her numbers as the business grows. 

If you can help Martha set off on the right foot, please get in touch with her using the below details:

Christina is a facialist and advanced aesthetician who has been running her practice for just over a year. She is looking for an accountant to assist and guide her in the next stage of her business - scaling. With the first year of trading complete, the next step is growth, particularly through social media marketing. Christina needs a helpful, patient and efficient accountant to help her understand what allowances and expenses she is entitled to, and how the numbers can be used to drive growth. 

Christina Bethany Patchett runs Christina Bethany, a beauty business she has been building for the past 16 months. She works as a sole trader, with a current turnover of around £21,000.

Day to day, Christina uses QuickBooks, but finds the terminology difficult and isn’t confident she is recording things correctly. Her main priority is to make sure her financial records are accurate and to gain clarity around what benefits and reliefs she may be entitled to as a small business owner.

Her focus for growth in the next year is client acquisition, with a particular emphasis on developing a strong social media strategy to attract new customers organically. She would like an accountant who can not only ensure compliance but also help her build confidence and understanding in managing her accounts.

Laura is a contractor specialising in RPA development. Having increased her day rate and built up a healthy profit margin, she’s now looking to plan ahead for maternity leave next year - maximising the value of her work now to give herself financial breathing room later. She’s ready to work with an accountant who’s proactive, detail-oriented, and can guide her through the next 12-18 months with clarity and care.

Laura Gallagher runs Allora Solutions Limited, a limited company offering RPA Developer services. She’s been trading for just under two years and generated £86,210 in turnover over the past 12 months, with an operating profit of £60,632. She has no employees and handles her bookkeeping through FreeAgent, with support from an external accountant.

There are no plans for rapid growth - Laura has recently raised her day rate and wants to maintain that momentum while preparing for maternity leave in 2026. Her current focus is on making smart financial decisions now to ensure she can pay herself a sustainable income while on leave.

Her main frustration with her current setup is a lack of proactivity. She often has to ask the right questions in order to get the right answers - and isn’t always confident she’s getting reliable guidance. She’s looking for an accountant who will take the lead in advising her, offer clarity around long-term planning, and make her feel confident and supported in the lead-up to maternity.

Yasmin is a growth marketing specialist who recently returned to the UK from New York. She set up a limited company in March 2025 to support a single US-based client while temporarily back in the UK, forecasting a turnover of around £125k before she plans to move back to the States.

After a couple of years in New York, Yasmin Li returned to the UK for personal reasons and incorporated a limited company in March 2025. The business isn’t built for growth; instead, it’s purely a trading vehicle that allows her to keep working with one high-value US client until she relocates back to the US next year. Forecast turnover sits around £125,000, with no plans to expand or bring on new clients.

Yasmin is feeling understandably overwhelmed by the UK accounting requirements, especially given her short stay and dual residency considerations. She’s looking for an accountant who can patiently break things down, help claim every allowable expense to stay as tax efficient as possible, and guide her through the statutory residency tests that may affect her personal tax return. She’d also like thoughtful advice on some less typical costs - like US apartment rent and visa expenses - to understand if these could be claimed. Investigation Insurance is of interest too, for extra peace of mind.

Ideally, Yasmin hopes to work with someone experienced in cross-border tax who understands the pressure of juggling UK and US rules, and who can offer calm, clear support throughout her brief time trading in the UK.

Maddison and Bret are a creative husband-and-wife duo running separate businesses -lifestyle consultancy on one side, metal art and industrial projects on the other. Both are ready to take things more seriously and get organised for growth.

Maddison May Kapetanov Nee Brundell runs a lifestyle consultancy brand ‘Maddison May’ built on her experience as a model, bringing in around £30,000 turnover in the last year. She currently uses her banking app and keeps receipts, but wants help moving to proper bookkeeping, understanding what can be claimed, and getting ready to expand into new revenue streams. Maddison works mainly with contractors rather than employees.

Bret Kapetanov recently set up Primeman Ltd, focused on welding, metal art, and industrial mechanical work. It’s only been trading a few months, with modest turnover so far and no profit yet, but the goal is to grow, hire a small team, and eventually sell the business as an established company. Right now, Bret keeps receipts manually and uses the Tide banking app.

Both Maddison and Bret are looking for support to professionalise, manage tax more efficiently, and move away from basic manual tracking so they can focus on growing their businesses.

Russell pivoted from employment to self-employment last October, joining forces with a host travel agency. With an eye on growth, he needs assistance with incorporating his business and is looking for the right accountant to give clear direction and advice. He’s also happy to set up Xero or QuickBooks with the right support.

Russell Moore is an independent travel agent trading under 1000 Miles. After leaving employment in October last year, he’s now operating as a sole trader with modest expensing needs, since the host agency reimburses most costs directly.

In his first trading period, Russell generated around £11,000 in income, and projects £25,000 for 2025–26. Longer term, he’s ambitious: once fully established, he expects to reach annual revenues between £350,000–£400,000.

Russell’s immediate priority is ensuring his 2024–25 self-assessment is completed accurately and efficiently. Incorporation is also a pressing matter, so he can continue working under the 1000 Miles umbrella as a limited company and scale up sustainably.

Nicole Cheetham, founder of Be In Tech Recruitment, is looking for an experienced accountant to help bring clarity and confidence to her financial setup. Running a high-performing recruitment business while raising a young child, Nicole is focused on stability, simplicity, and smart financial decision-making.

Having built the business over the past year, she currently invoices around £7,200 + VAT per month and expects turnover to stay steady at £75–100k + VAT annually. The business is a vehicle to generate solid income in a flexible way while her family is the top priority.

Nicole uses accounting software and outsources bookkeeping, but she’s seeking a deeper understanding of her financial picture—what’s happening, what it means, and how to make it work smarter. She's especially keen to get real-time visibility into cash flow, as well as support with more complex tax considerations, such as the liquidation of ESPP shares and general tax efficiency.

Katie De Salis is looking for an experienced accountant to support a new chapter of growth and business evolution. After five years running a successful hyperlocal community channel spotlighting events, small businesses, and local news, Katie is taking the leap—leaving full-time employment to pursue freelance work and fully focus on building the business.

With a current turnover of £20,610 and a dedicated audience nurtured organically, the business is now expanding beyond social media into newsletters and other platforms to create new revenue streams. To match this growth, Katie is seeking an accountant who can help create a smooth, reliable system for invoicing, tax returns, and long-term financial planning—whether operating as a Limited Company or Sole Trader.

To date, all financial records have been managed solo via a single Excel spreadsheet. With more time now being dedicated to active sales outreach and business development, the need for a scalable, structured financial process is clear. The right accountant will help set up systems that are not only compliant, but also easy to manage and designed to support future growth.

This is an exciting opportunity to work alongside a community-first entrepreneur committed to turning a side hustle into a sustainable business that supports both local economies and personal creative freedom.

**Business Split – Risk Assessment & Tax Guidance**
*Prepared by Innspired Accountancy*

---

**1. VAT – Disaggregation Risk**

HMRC has strict rules regarding ""disaggregation"" – artificial business splits designed to avoid VAT registration or reduce VAT liability.

**To ensure your split is compliant, you must demonstrate:**

* **Separate Legal Entities:** Each part should ideally be a distinct legal entity (e.g., limited companies).
* **Independent Operations:** Business operations and decisions must be independent.
* **Separate Records:** Maintain separate records, bank accounts, and accounting systems.
* **Distinct Activities:** Clearly different trading activities and branding.
* **Premises:** Either separate premises or a formal lease/licence agreement if sharing space.
* **Independent Staff:** Separate staff and employment arrangements.

**You must AVOID:**

* Sharing key staff, systems, or customers without clear commercial justification.
* A split structured solely to keep both entities below the VAT threshold.
* Any appearance of operating as a single business under different names.

***Warning:** If HMRC suspects an artificial split, they can treat the entities as one for VAT purposes and issue backdated assessments and penalties.*

---

**2. Corporation Tax – Marginal Relief & Associated Companies**

Corporation Tax thresholds for the small profits rate and marginal relief are divided among ""associated companies.""

**Definition (from April 2023):** Two companies are associated if:
* One company controls the other, OR
* Both companies are controlled by the same person or group of persons (this includes family members or business partners).

**Impact of Association:**
* If your split results in associated companies, the £50,000 small profits rate threshold and the £250,000 marginal relief upper limit are divided between them.
* *Example:* With 2 associated companies, each company only gets a £25,000 threshold for the small profits rate and a £125,000 limit for marginal relief before the full 25% Corporation Tax rate applies.

**HMRC will consider:**
* Who ultimately owns or controls each company.
* Whether there is a *genuine commercial reason* for the split.
* Whether the split appears motivated solely by tax advantages.

---

**Summary & Next Steps**

* We strongly recommend proceeding with a business split *only if* it has clear, demonstrable commercial justification beyond tax savings.
* We will assist you in structuring the split carefully and documenting the commercial rationale.
* Please inform us if you require help with company incorporation, setting up separate bookkeeping, or VAT registration for the new entities.

**Client Guide – Splitting Your Business**

**Overview**

Splitting a business can offer commercial, operational, and potential tax advantages. However, HMRC scrutinises these arrangements closely to prevent the artificial avoidance of VAT registration thresholds and the manipulation of Corporation Tax marginal relief rules. A poorly planned or unjustified split can lead to challenges, resulting in backdated tax liabilities, penalties, and significant compliance issues.

---

**1. VAT – Artificial Separation (Disaggregation)**

HMRC may deem a split artificial and treat multiple businesses as a single entity for VAT purposes if they believe the separation is not genuine.

**Acceptable Structure Characteristics:**

* **Separate Legal Entities:** E.g., two distinct Limited companies.
* **Different Activities:** Offering different business activities, targeting different customers, or providing different services.
* **Operational Independence:** Demonstrable separation through own staff, branding, records, bank accounts, and management decision-making.

**Risky Indicators:**

* Sharing the same business location without formal, commercial lease/licence agreements.
* Significant overlap in staff, branding, suppliers, or customer bases.
* The primary motivation for the split appears to be keeping turnover below the £90,000 VAT registration threshold (as of current guidance).

---

**2. Corporation Tax – Associated Companies**

The benefits of Corporation Tax marginal relief (the gradual increase from the small profits rate to the main rate) are restricted by thresholds. These thresholds (£50k lower limit, £250k upper limit as of April 2023) are *divided* between associated companies.

**Companies are likely associated if:**

* They are controlled by the same person(s).
* Control involves connected parties (e.g., spouses, civil partners, close family members, trustees of settlements).

**Consequence:** The tax relief thresholds are shared.
* *Example:* Two associated companies share the £250,000 marginal relief upper threshold. Each company effectively only has a £125,000 threshold before the full 25% Corporation Tax rate applies.

---

**3. What HMRC Looks For**

HMRC examines two key aspects:

* **Control & Influence:** Both formal (shareholdings, directorships) and informal control structures.
* **Commercial Rationale:** The underlying business reason for the split (e.g., launching a new product line, segregating risk, distinct branding initiatives, preparing part of the business for sale).

*A weak commercial case combined with unclear operational separation is a major red flag for HMRC.*

---

**4. Our Advice**

* Only proceed with a business split if it supports genuine commercial or operational needs. Tax benefits should be a secondary consequence, not the primary driver.
* We can help you establish the correct legal, financial, and tax structures to support the split.
* Be prepared to clearly explain and provide evidence for your decision if HMRC makes an enquiry. Keep thorough records of the rationale and implementation.

**Business Split Risk Checklist**

**LEGAL STRUCTURE**
* [ ] Is each business a legally separate entity (e.g., Limited Company, LLP)?
* [ ] Are Companies House and HMRC registrations complete and distinct for each entity?

**OPERATIONS**
* [ ] Does each business have its own dedicated bank account?
* [ ] Does each business use separate accounting software or ledgers?
* [ ] Does each business file its own tax returns (VAT, PAYE, CT)?
* [ ] Does each business manage its own staff and payroll independently?
* [ ] Is day-to-day decision-making genuinely independent (e.g., separate directors or clear mandates for separate management)?

**TRADING ACTIVITY**
* [ ] Does each business offer genuinely different services or products?
* [ ] Does each business target a distinct customer base or market segment?
* [ ] Are branding, websites, marketing materials, and public presence clearly separate?

**PREMISES & LOGISTICS**
* [ ] Do the businesses operate from entirely separate premises?
* [ ] OR, if space is shared, is there a formal, commercial lease or licence agreement in place with clear demarcation and signage?
* [ ] Are back-office systems (IT, phone lines) separate, or if shared, is there clear justification and separation of data/usage?

**VAT SPECIFIC**
* [ ] Would each entity likely need to register for VAT if its turnover exceeded the £90,000 threshold independently?
* [ ] Is it clear the split's primary purpose is NOT to artificially keep turnover below the VAT threshold?

**CORPORATION TAX**
* [ ] Are the ownership and control structures distinct?
* [ ] OR, if control is shared (making them associated), are you fully aware of the associated company rules and the impact on tax thresholds?
* [ ] Do you understand that marginal relief thresholds (£50k/£250k) will be divided between associated companies?
* [ ] Is there a clearly documented commercial reason for the split, unrelated to tax avoidance?

**DOCUMENTATION**
* [ ] Do you have a written rationale outlining the commercial reasons for the split?
* [ ] Are there board minutes, internal strategy notes, or other documents supporting the business case?
* [ ] Do contracts (e.g., leases, key supplier agreements, customer terms) reflect the separation between the entities?",,High,Hot,,Jonathan - 2025-04-16T15:37:54.761Z,£0.00,,,30,True,Professional consultation with company directors to discuss the proposed business separation and preliminary tax/VAT implications.,9,,,,

Emilie is looking for an accountant who can help her to incorporate her limited company, register her for VAT and provide strategy during her next phase of growth!

Emilie is a money coach and financial strategist, she’s a sole trader and has been running her business just a little over a year. 

She’s turning over just under £50,000 with projections of £135,000 in 2025. She doesn’t have any employees and plans to remain this way.

She tracks her finances on a spreadsheet and is happy doing this for now, but as she grows she would like to upgrade her systems and introduce accounting software.

She’d like to incorporate to become a limited company and be prepared to register for VAT as she will hit the threshold during April 2025.
