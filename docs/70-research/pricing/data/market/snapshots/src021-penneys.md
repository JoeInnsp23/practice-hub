## Positioning vs Practice Hub

### Similarities
- ✅ Turnover-based banding (matches our Model A)
- ✅ Simple pricing structure (easy to understand)
- ✅ Fixed fees (no hourly rates)

### Differences
- ❌ Fewer turnover bands (5 vs our 7) - less granular
- ❌ No transaction-based pricing (we offer Model B)
- ❌ Less sophisticated (no dual-model, no packages)
- ✅ CIS focus (construction niche)

### Practice Hub Competitive Positioning

**Where We're More Competitive:**
- **Granularity:** 7 turnover bands vs their 5 (more precise pricing)
- **Sophistication:** Dual-model vs turnover-only
- **Director payroll:** £18 vs their £30 (40% cheaper)
- **Technology:** Cloud-native vs traditional

**Where They're More Competitive:**
- **Regional pricing:** Lower prices for East Anglia market
- **CIS specialization:** Flat £30/month (simple, attractive for construction)
- **Simplicity:** 5 bands (easier to choose)

**Key Takeaway:** Penney's represents regional, traditional firms. Their simplified banding (5 bands) makes pricing easier to communicate but sacrifices precision. Practice Hub's 7 bands + dual-model offers better accuracy without excessive complexity.

### Phone-First vs Digital-First
