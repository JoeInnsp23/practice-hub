## Positioning vs Practice Hub

### Similarities
- ✅ Turnover-based banding (matches our Model A)
- ✅ Transparent pricing philosophy
- ✅ Fixed fees, no hidden charges
- ✅ Per-property rental addon (£30 - same as our target)

### Differences
- ❌ No transaction-based pricing (we offer Model B)
- ❌ Less granular turnover bands below £100k (we have more bands)
- ❌ Higher director-only payroll (£18 vs our £18 - match!)

### Practice Hub Competitive Positioning

**Where We're More Competitive:**
- £0-£89k turnover: Our £300-£660 range vs their £300-£600
- Transaction-based pricing for high-volume businesses (they don't offer)
- Dual-model recommendation engine (better value for clients)

**Where They're More Competitive:**
- Package deals (they have pre-defined packages, we customize)
- Simplicity (fewer choices, easier to understand)

**Key Takeaway:** RJ Accountancy's pricing validates our Model A structure and price points. Our dual-model approach gives us a competitive edge for high-transaction businesses.
