## Positioning vs Practice Hub

### Similarities
- ✅ Turnover-based pricing for accounts/tax
- ✅ Per-return pricing for VAT

### Differences
- ❌ Wide price ranges (£500-£700 vs our fixed £600)
- ❌ Less transparent (payroll/bookkeeping not fully disclosed)
- ❌ Hourly bookkeeping (vs our transaction-based Model B)
- ❌ No package deals

### Practice Hub Competitive Positioning

**Where We're More Competitive:**
- **Transparency:** Fixed prices vs ranges (builds trust)
- **Predictability:** Transaction-based bookkeeping vs hourly
- **Value:** Lower self-assessment (£180 vs their £150-£200)
- **Model B:** Transaction-based pricing (they don't offer)

**Where They're More Competitive:**
- **Flexibility:** Can quote lower for simple cases (£500 vs our £600 minimum)
- **Local presence:** High-street office (we're cloud-first)

**Key Takeaway:** Heights Accountancy represents traditional high-street firms. Their wide price ranges and hourly bookkeeping show less sophistication than cloud-native competitors. Practice Hub's transparent, fixed pricing is a strong differentiator.

## Market Positioning Insights

### Traditional vs Cloud-Native

**Observation:** Heights Accountancy caters to clients who prefer:
- Face-to-face meetings
- Phone-based support
- Local, personal service
- Traditional industry sectors (manufacturing, retail)

**Implication for Practice Hub:**
- Our cloud-first approach targets different segment
- Don't compete on local presence

---

### Pricing Transparency Trend

**Observation:** Market shift from "contact for quote" to "transparent pricing"
- Traditional firms (Heights): Wide ranges, "call us"
- Modern firms (RJ, 1st Cloud, Goforma): Exact prices, online calculators

**Application to Practice Hub:**
- ✅ Full transparency is now market expectation
- ✅ Pricing preview (Phase 3) aligns with market trend
- ✅ Exact pricing > ranges = competitive advantage

---

### Hourly Bookkeeping Obsolescence

**Observation:** Heights charges £30-£40/hour for bookkeeping
- Problem: Unpredictable monthly costs (client doesn't know if 10 or 20 hours needed)
- Modern alternative: Transaction-based or fixed monthly (1st Cloud, Practice Hub Model B)

**Application to Practice Hub:**
- ✅ Transaction-based pricing (Model B) is superior
- Marketing angle: "Predictable bookkeeping pricing" vs "hourly surprises"
