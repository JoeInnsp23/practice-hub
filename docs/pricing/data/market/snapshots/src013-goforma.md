## Positioning vs Practice Hub

### Similarities
- ✅ Package-based tiers (Micro/Starter/Growth/Enterprise similar to our Essentials/Standard/Plus)
- ✅ Add-on pricing for extras (rental properties, additional SATRs)
- ✅ Company formation offering

### Differences
- ❌ No turnover-based banding (packages only)
- ❌ No transaction-based pricing for bookkeeping
- ❌ Contractor focus (we're more general SME)

### Practice Hub Competitive Positioning

**Where We're More Competitive:**
- Flexibility: Dual-model (turnover + transaction) vs package-only
- Granularity: Model A turnover bands vs fixed packages
- Bookkeeping: Transaction-based pricing (fairer for low-volume businesses)

**Where They're More Competitive:**
- Contractor niche: IR35 support, dividend processing
- Formation speed: 24-hour fast track (we don't offer formation yet)
- Simplicity: 4 clear packages vs our complex dual-model

**Key Takeaway:** Goforma's contractor focus shows a viable niche strategy. Their package pricing (£600-£3,000/year) aligns with our tier targets. Consider adding contractor-specific features (IR35, dividend processing) as future enhancement.
