## Positioning vs Practice Hub

### Similarities
- ✅ Monthly retainer packages (we have Essentials/Standard/Plus tiers)
- ✅ Transaction-based bookkeeping (matches our Model B)
- ✅ Cloud-native approach (Xero focus)

### Differences
- ❌ Package model only (no turnover-based à la carte like our Model A)
- ❌ Less granular pricing (3 packages vs our flexible dual-model)
- ❌ Higher payroll pricing (£25 director vs our £18)

### Practice Hub Competitive Positioning

**Where We're More Competitive:**
- Director-only payroll: £18 vs their £25 (28% cheaper)
- Flexibility: Dual-model (turnover + transaction) vs package-only
- Granularity: Custom pricing vs fixed packages

**Where They're More Competitive:**
- Simplicity: 3 clear packages vs our complex dual-model
- Marketing: Easier to explain packages than dual pricing

**Key Takeaway:** 1st Cloud validates the package approach (Essentials/Professional/Premium) as an alternative to our dual-model. Their higher payroll pricing suggests market tolerance for £20-£25 range (our £18 is very competitive).
