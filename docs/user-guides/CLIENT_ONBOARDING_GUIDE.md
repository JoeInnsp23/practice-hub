## Welcome

Thank you for choosing Innspired Accountancy! We're excited to work with you.

Before we can start providing services, UK law requires us to verify your identity and conduct basic compliance checks. This process is called **Know Your Customer (KYC)** and is required under the **Money Laundering Regulations 2017**.

**Good news**: The entire process takes about **10-15 minutes** and is completed online from the comfort of your home or office.

---

## Why Onboarding?

### Legal Requirements

UK law requires all accounting firms to:
- **Verify your identity** before providing services
- **Conduct AML (Anti-Money Laundering) checks** to prevent financial crime
- **Maintain records** of these checks for regulatory compliance

### What We Check

1. **Identity Verification**: Confirm you are who you say you are
2. **Document Verification**: Validate your ID document is genuine
3. **Facial Recognition**: Match your live photo to ID document
4. **AML Screening**: Check against government watchlists (standard procedure, not personal)

**Rest assured**: This is a legal requirement for all clients, not a reflection on you personally.

---

## What You'll Need

### Required Documents

**One of the following** (original, not photocopy):

✅ **UK Passport** (current or expired within last 3 months)
✅ **UK Driving Licence** (photocard, not paper)

### Technical Requirements

✅ **Device with camera**: Smartphone, tablet, or computer with webcam
✅ **Well-lit area**: Natural light or bright room lighting

✅ **Internet connection**: Stable connection for document upload

### Information You'll Need

- Personal details (name, date of birth, address)

---

### Step 5: Identity Verification (LEM Verify)

**What is LEM Verify?**
- Our identity verification partner
- FCA-regulated and UK GDPR compliant
- Used by banks, solicitors, and accountants across the UK
- Conducts checks in real-time (2-5 minutes)

**What They Check**:

**1. Document Verification** (30 seconds)
- Is the document genuine?
- Is it valid and not expired?
- Does it match government databases?

**2. Facial Recognition** (1 minute)
- Take a selfie
- System compares your live photo to ID document photo
- Ensures you're the person on the ID

**3. Liveness Detection** (1 minute)
- Proves you're a real person (not a photo or video)
- May ask you to turn head, smile, or blink
- Prevents fraud

**4. AML Screening** (2 minutes)
- Check against UK and international watchlists:
  - **PEP**: Politically Exposed Persons
  - **Sanctions**: Government sanctions lists
  - **Watchlists**: Law enforcement watchlists
  - **Adverse Media**: Financial crime news

**How It Works**:

1. **Click "Start Verification"**
2. **Grant camera permission** (required for selfie)
3. **Review your ID document** (already uploaded)
4. **Take a selfie**:
   - Look directly at camera
   - Remove glasses and hats
   - Ensure good lighting
   - Keep face in frame
5. **Complete liveness check**:
   - Follow on-screen instructions
   - May ask you to turn head left/right
   - May ask you to smile or blink
   - Takes 30-60 seconds
6. **Wait for results** (1-2 minutes)

**Tips for Successful Verification**:
- ✅ Use a well-lit room (natural light best)
- ✅ Look directly at camera
- ✅ Keep face in frame
- ✅ Follow instructions carefully
- ✅ Stay still during checks
- ❌ Don't wear sunglasses or hats
- ❌ Don't use filters or beauty modes
- ❌ Don't cover your face

**What if verification fails?**
- Common causes: Poor lighting, blurry photo, incorrect document
- You can retry immediately (up to 3 attempts)
- After 3 attempts, contact support for assistance

---

## What Happens Next

### Instant Auto-Approval (Most Common)

**If all checks pass**:
✅ Document verified
✅ Face match passed (score > 80%)
✅ Liveness passed (score > 80%)
✅ AML clear (no matches)

**You'll see**:
- ✅ **"Verification Successful"** message
- 🎉 **"Welcome to Innspired Accountancy!"**
- Email confirmation within minutes
- Immediate access to client portal

**Next steps**:
1. Check email for welcome message
2. Log in to client portal
3. Set up portal password (if using email/password)
4. Start uploading documents for your accountant
5. Your accountant will be in touch within 1 business day

---

### Manual Review (Rare - ~5% of cases)

**If flagged for review**:
⚠️ One or more checks require human review
⚠️ Don't worry - this is normal and doesn't mean anything is wrong!

**Common reasons**:
- Low facematch score (e.g., passport photo is old)
- Low liveness score (e.g., poor lighting)
- AML match (e.g., similar name to someone on watchlist)
- Document issues (e.g., slight damage to ID)

**What happens**:
1. You'll see **"Verification Under Review"** message
2. Our compliance team reviews your case manually
3. We may request additional information or documents
4. Decision made within 24 hours (usually much faster)

**You'll receive email**:
- Explaining review status
- What additional information needed (if any)
- Expected timeline

**Review outcomes**:

**Approved ✅**
- Same as auto-approval
- Portal access granted
- Welcome email sent

**Requires More Information ℹ️**
- Email with specific requests
- Upload additional documents
- Verification resumes after you provide info

**Rejected ❌** (very rare)
- Email explaining reason
- Option to re-verify with corrected information
- Or contact us to discuss

---

### Re-Verification Process

**If you need to re-verify**:

1. **Receive email** with re-verification link
2. **Review rejection reason**
3. **Prepare better documents**:
   - Use higher quality photos
   - Ensure better lighting
   - Try different ID document (e.g., passport instead of licence)
4. **Start re-verification**:
   - Same process as before
   - Upload new/better photos
   - Complete questionnaire again (pre-filled with previous answers)
5. **Submit for verification**

**Tips for successful re-verification**:
- ✅ Address the specific issue mentioned in rejection email
- ✅ Use professional quality photos (not phone camera if possible)
- ✅ Scan documents if available (better than photos)
- ✅ Contact support if unsure how to improve

---

## Questionnaire Guide

### Common Questions Answered

**Q: Why do you need my source of funds?**
A: UK law requires us to understand where your money comes from to prevent money laundering. This is standard for all clients.

**Q: What if I have multiple income sources?**
A: Select all that apply and provide details for each. Most people have 2-3 sources (e.g., employment + savings).

**Q: How accurate do turnover estimates need to be?**
A: Approximate is fine. We're looking for £50k vs £500k, not exact amounts. Round to nearest £10k or £50k.

**Q: What if my business is new and has no turnover yet?**
A: Enter "0" or "£0 - £10,000" and note "New business, first year" in details.

**Q: What if I don't know my company number?**
A: Find it on Companies House website (free lookup) or any official company documents.

**Q: Can someone help me complete the questionnaire?**
A: Yes! Email or call us. We can guide you through it, or even complete it with you over the phone.

- Even if match found, doesn't automatically disqualify you

**What if I'm flagged?**
- We'll review manually
- You may need to provide additional information
- We'll explain clearly what we need
- Process can take 24-48 hours instead of instant

  - Ensure document is genuine and current
  - Take better quality photo (see photo tips above)
  - Try different lighting
  - Try scanning instead of photo

  - Ensure good lighting on face
  - Look directly at camera
  - Try neutral expression
  - If ID photo is very old, consider renewing ID and re-verifying

  - Improve room lighting

  - Follow instructions precisely
  - Complete full range of motion for each instruction
