## Implementation Guidelines

### Category Assignment Rules

1. **Single Primary Category**: Each SOP must belong to one primary category
2. **Subcategory Required**: All SOPs must be assigned to a subcategory (not just top-level)
3. **Tagging for Cross-Reference**: Use tags for SOPs that span multiple categories

### Naming Conventions

**Format:** `[Category Code]-[SOP Number]-[Short Title]`

**Examples:**
- `GOV-1.1-001-AML-Client-Risk-Assessment.pdf`
- `CLI-2.1-005-Engagement-Letter-Template.pdf`
- `TEC-3.2-012-Corporation-Tax-Return-Checklist.pdf`

### Version Control

- **Major version change (1.0 → 2.0)**: Significant procedure change
- **Minor version change (1.0 → 1.1)**: Clarifications or small updates
- **Patch version (1.1 → 1.1.1)**: Typo fixes (optional)

## Customization Guidance

While this taxonomy provides a standardized baseline, tenants may:

1. **Add custom subcategories** within existing top-level categories
2. **Hide unused categories** if not applicable to their practice
3. **Add custom tags** for cross-category filtering
4. **Create custom category icons** (future enhancement)

## Rationale

### ISO 9001 Alignment

This taxonomy aligns with ISO 9001:2015 Quality Management System requirements:
- **Section 4**: Context of the organization (Governance)
- **Section 5**: Leadership (HR, Performance)
- **Section 7**: Support (IT Systems, Training)
- **Section 8**: Operation (Client Services, Technical)
- **Section 9**: Performance evaluation (Quality Review)
- **Section 10**: Improvement (Continuous improvement processes)

### GxP Compliance

The structure supports GxP compliance requirements:
- **Document Control**: Versioning and approval workflows
- **Training Records**: Link SOPs to training completion tracking
- **Audit Trail**: Complete reading and acknowledgment history

### Accountancy-Specific Standards

Categories reflect:
- **ICAEW Practice Assurance** scheme requirements
- **ACCA Quality Assurance** guidelines
- **Money Laundering Regulations 2017** (AML/KYC categories)
- **GDPR Article 30** (Record of processing activities)

## Maintenance

This taxonomy should be reviewed:
- **Annually**: During internal quality reviews
- **Regulatory Changes**: When new compliance requirements emerge
- **Practice Changes**: When firm services evolve significantly
